  abstract = {This article proposes and analyzes several variants of the randomized Cholesky QR factorization of a matrix \$X\$. Instead of computing the R factor from \$X\textasciicircum T X\$, as is done by standard methods, we obtain it from a small, efficiently computable random sketch of \$X\$, thus saving computational cost and improving numerical stability. The proposed direct variant of the randomized Cholesky QR requires only half the flops and the same communication cost as the classical Cholesky QR. At the same time, it is more robust since it is guaranteed to be stable whenever the input matrix is numerically full-rank. The rank-revealing randomized Cholesky QR variant has the ability to sort out the linearly dependent columns of \$X\$, which allows to have an unconditional numerical stability and reduce the computational cost when \$X\$ is rank-deficient. We also depict a column-oriented randomized Cholesky QR that establishes the connection with the randomized Gram-Schmidt process, and a reduced variant that outputs a low-dimensional projection of the Q factor rather than the full factor and therefore yields drastic computational savings. It is shown that performing minor operations in higher precision in the proposed algorithms can allow stability with working unit roundoff independent of the dominant matrix dimension. This feature may be of particular interest for a QR factorization of tall-and-skinny matrices on low-precision architectures.},

  abstract = {Shot detection is widely used in video semantic analysis, video scene segmentation, and video retrieval. However, this is still a challenging task, due to the weak boundary and a sudden change in brightness or foreground objects. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for shot boundary detection. Because the DMD can extract several temporal foreground modes and one temporal background mode from video data, shot boundaries can be detected when the amplitude changes sharply. Here, the amplitude is the DMD coefficient to restore the video. The main idea behind the shot boundaries detection is finding the amplitude change of background mode. We can reduce error detection when the illumination changes sharply or the foreground object (or camera) moves very quickly. At the same time, our algorithm has a high detection accuracy, even the color changes are not obvious, the illumination changes slowly, or the foreground objects overlap. Meanwhile, a color space for DMD is selected for reducing false detection. Finally, the effectiveness of our method will be demonstrated through detecting the shot boundaries of the various content types of videos.},

The problems of high dimension, noisy data, theoretical foundation in connection with the Koopman operator and ergodic theory, and potential applicability in broad spectrum of engineering problems have triggered extensive research and resulted in many theoretical and computational advancements of the DMD framework.

It provides a new numerically robust computational tool for data driven Koopman spectral analysis, based on the natural formulation via the Krylov decomposition with the Frobenius companion matrix, and by using its eigenvectors explicitly---these are the columns of the inverse of the notoriously ill-conditioned  Vandermonde matrix. The key step to curb ill-conditioning is the discrete Fourier transform of the snapshots; in the new representation, the Vandermonde matrix is transformed into a generalized Cauchy matrix, which then allows accurate computation by specially tailored algorithms of numerical linear algebra. The second goal is to shed light on the connection between the formulas for optimal reconstruction weights when reconstructing snapshots using subsets of the computed Koopman modes. It is shown how using a certain weaker form of generalized inverses leads to explicit reconstruction formulas that match the abstract results from Koopman spectral theory, in particular the generalized Laplace analysis.}

In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available.  The algorithm does not require storage of past data and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates.  A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems.  A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of ``windowed DMD,'' in which only the most recent data are used.  The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment.  In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.}

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a regression technique that integrates two of the leading data analysis methods in use today: Fourier transforms and singular value decomposition. Borrowing ideas from compressed sensing and matrix sketching, cDMD eases the computational workload of high resolution video processing. The key principal of cDMD is to obtain the decomposition on a (small) compressed matrix representation of the video feed. Hence, the cDMD algorithm scales with the intrinsic rank of the matrix, rather then the size of the actual video (data) matrix. Selection of the optimal modes characterizing the background is formulated as a sparsity-constrained sparse coding problem. Our results show, that the quality of the resulting background model is competitive, quantified by the F-measure, Recall and Precision. A GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated implementation is also presented which further boosts the computational efficiency of the algorithm.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a randomized Householder QR factorization (RHQR). This factorization can be used to obtain a well conditioned basis of a set of vectors and thus can be employed in a variety of applications. The RHQR factorization of the input matrix {$W$}WW is equivalent to the standard Householder QR factorization of matrix {$\PsiW\Psi$}W\textbackslash Psi W, where {$\Psi\Psi\backslash$}Psi is a sketching matrix that can be obtained from any subspace embedding technique. For this reason, the RHQR algorithm can also be reconstructed from the Householder QR factorization of the sketched problem. In most contexts, left-looking RHQR requires a single synchronization per iteration, with half the computational cost of Householder QR, and a similar cost to Randomized Gram-Schmidt (RGS) overall.   We discuss the usage of RHQR factorization in the Arnoldi process and then in GMRES, showing thus how it can be used in Krylov subspace methods to solve systems of linear equations. Based on Charles Sheffield's connection between Householder QR and Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS), a randomized Modified Gram Schmidt (RMGS) process is also derived.  Numerical experiments show that RHQR produces a well conditioned basis whose sketch is numerically orthogonal, and an accurate factorization. For some very difficult cases, it can be more stable than RGS in both unique precision (half, single, or double) and mixed precision.}

The method is a novel application of a technique used for characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose Fourier components in time are known. DMD terms with Fourier frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given video frames, and the terms with Fourier frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. An approximate low-rank/sparse separation is achieved at the computational cost of just one singular value decomposition and one linear equation solve, thus producing results orders of magnitude faster than a leading separation method, namely robust principal component analysis (RPCA). The DMD method that is developed here is demonstrated to work robustly in real-time with personal laptop-class computing power and without any parameter tuning, which is a transformative improvement in performance that is ideal for video surveillance and recognition applications.},

More specifically, our proposed algorithm takes advantage of the special structures of arrowhead and diagonal-plus-rank-one matrices involved in updating SVD models to expedite the updating process. Moreover, because the singular values are computed independently, the proposed method can be easily parallelized. In addition, as this paper shows, increasing rank can lead to more accurate singular values in the updating process. Experimental results from synthetic and real data sets demonstrate gains in efficiency and accuracy in the updating process.}

Numerical experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the scheme is for every matrix that was tried at least as good as column-pivoted QR and is sometimes much better. Computational speed is also improved substantially, in particular on GPU architectures.}

They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \& Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.}

In this study, we propose dynamic mode decomposition via dictionary learning (dl-DMD), which is applied to extract moving objects by separating the sequence of video frames into foreground and background information with a dictionary learned using block patches on the video frames. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) decomposes spatiotemporal data into spatial modes, each of whose temporal behavior is characterized by a single frequency and growth/decay rate and is applicable to split a video into foregrounds and the background when applying it to a video. And, in dl-DMD, DMD is applied on coefficient matrices estimated over a learned dictionary, which enables accurate estimation of dynamical information in videos. Due to this scheme, dl-DMD can analyze the dynamics of respective regions in a video based on estimated amplitudes and temporal evolution over patches. The results on synthetic data exhibit that dl-DMD outperforms the standard DMD and compressed DMD (cDMD) based methods. Also, the results of an empirical performance evaluation in the case of foreground extraction from videos using publicly available dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed dl-DMD algorithm and achieves a performance that is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art techniques in foreground extraction tasks.}

  abstract = {The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a ``black box'' integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the ``stochastic Koopman operator'' (Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1--3): 309--325,~2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.}
